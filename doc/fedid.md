# Identity Federator


The Identity federator service permits user connection using different identity credentials.

## Introduction

This application launches an HTTPS server protecting an ``/apps`` path.
Users must present valid credentials to access that protected path.

Credentials may be:
* X509 certificate
* an external identity provided by an OAuth server

## Requirements


The application is written in [Go language](http://golang.org/ "Go").

This expects some external packages:

* github.com/apexskier/httpauth
* github.com/gorilla/mux
* golang.org/x/oauth2

One can easily installs them :

```
$> go get github.com/apexskier/httpauth github.com/gorilla/mux golang.org/x/oauth2 
```


## Configuration


The application needs a [Json](http://json.org/ "Json") configuration file.

This file may be found from :

* command line parameter (e.g.: ``$> fedid /home/user/conf/myconf.json``)
* ../conf/fedid.json (relative to the binary path)
* /etc/fedid.json

### Configuration variables

Some variables may be set in the configuration file.

Goal             | Name        |  Requirement | Comments
-----------------|-------------|--------------|---------
Logger level     |Â loggerlevel |  *Optionnal*   | Possible values: ``finest``, ``debug``, ``config``, ``info`` (**default**), ``warn``, ``error``, ``fatal``
Path containing CA certificates| cacertpath  | *Optionnal*  | If not set, users won't be able to authenticate using X509 certificate (see [certification-authorities](#certification-authorities))
Server certificate path | certpath | **Required** | Program exits, if not set (see [server keys](#server-keys))
Server private key path | keypath | **Required** | Program exits, if not set (see [server keys](#server-keys))
Listened HTTPS port | portnumber  |  *Optionnal*   | Default: 4325
An array containing OAuth servers configuration | OAuthServers | *Optionnal* | If not set, users won't be able to authenticate using any external OAuth server


The "OAuthServers" variable is an array containing OAuth server configurations.
All OAuth server configuration variables are **required** and come from the OAuth server console, but **name**. That last must be set but its content is free.  

As example, one can find detailed instructions for the [Google OAuth service configuration](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/OAuth2/ "Google OAuth service configuration").


OAuth server configuration variables are listed below.

Goal              | Name        
------------------|-------------
Server name       | name 
Client identifier | clientid 
Client secret     | clientsecret
OAuth redirection | redirecturl
OAuth URL         | authurl
Token URL         |	tokenurl


**Please note that name must end the ``redirecturl`` variable. This is how the application retrieves the OAuth server to use.**

Example:
if name is ``google``, then the redirect URL must end with ``/google``. It must be something like 
```
https://myserver:myPort/aPath/google
https://myserver:myPort/google
https://myserver/aPath/google
https://myserver/google
```


### Configuration example

```
{
	"loggerlevel"      : "debug",
	"cacertpath"         : "",
	"certpath"         : "",
	"keypath"          : "",
	"portNumber"       : "",
	"OAuthServers" : [
		{
 			"name"         : "google", 
 			"clientid"     : "",
			"clientsecret" : "",
			"redirecturl"  : "https://something/path/google",
			"authurl"      : "https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth",
			"tokenurl"     : "https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/token"
		}
	]
}
```

### Certification Authorities 

In cryptography, a [Certificate Authority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_authority "Certificate Authority") is a trusted party
that may be used to both issue and verify credentials.
In order to verify user credentials presented as an electronic certificate, a service must have access to the full certificate path.

Most well known certificate paths are usually preinstalled in end user applications, such as web browsers.
If expected, specific certificate paths may be downloaded from certificate authority.

E.G.: CNRS CA proposes its certificate path at [IGC CNRS](https://igc.services.cnrs.fr/search_CA_certificate/?CA=CNRS2-Standard&lang=fr&body=view_ca.html "IGC CNRS").
  

### Server keys

The application launches a secured Web server.
To do so, a electronic keys pair is expected to:

* ensure the server identity
* encrypt communications

To generate a self signed key pair, one can run
```
$> go run /usr/local/go/src/crypto/tls/generate_cert.go --host localhost
```
